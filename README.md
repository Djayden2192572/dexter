# Dextermania: the game


my second unity game based around dexter. It's about dexter's rise to the top. 

Things to note: The jump physics demand dexter's center to be on something before being able to jump.

Press M To change music tracks.

in the event of someone falling in the final level they should reset the game, due to time constraints i haven't been able to add a death plane.
